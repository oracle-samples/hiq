HiQ is a `declarative`, `non-intrusive`, `dynamic` and `transparent` tracking system for both **monolithic** application and **distributed** system. It brings the runtime information tracking and optimization to a new level without compromising with speed and system performance, or hiding any tracking overhead information. HiQ applies for both I/O bound and CPU bound applications.

To explain the four features, **declarative** means you can declare the things you want to track in a text file, which could be a json, yaml or even csv,and no need to change program code. **Non-intrusive** means HiQ doesn't requires to modify original python code. **Dynamic** means HiQ supports tracing metrics featuring at run time, which can be used for adaptive tracing. **Transparent** means HiQ provides the tracing overhead and doesn't hide it no matter it is huge or tiny.

In addition to latency tracking, HiQ provides memory, disk I/O and Network I/O tracking out of the box. The output can be saved in form of normal line by line log file, or HiQ tree, or span graph.

HiQ's philosophy is to **decouple `observability logic` from `business logic`**. We don't have to enter the black hole to observe it.

## Installation

```bash
pip install hiq-python
```

## Get Started

Let start with a simplest example by running HiQ against a simple monolithic python code [ðŸ“„ `main.py`](hiq/examples/quick_start/main.py):

```python
# this is the main.py python source code
import time

def func1():
    time.sleep(1.5)
    print("func1")
    func2()

def func2():
    time.sleep(2.5)
    print("func2")

def main():
    func1()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, there is a simple chain of function calls: `main()` -> `func1` -> `func2`.

Now we want to trace the functions without modifying its code. Let's run the following:


```python
git clone https://github.com/oracle-samples/hiq.git
cd hiq/examples/quick_start
python main_driver.py
```

If everything is fine, you should be able to see the output like this:

![HiQ Simplest Example](hiq/docs/source/img/main_driver.jpg)

From the screenshot we can see the timestamp and the latency of each function:


|   | main  | func1  |  func2 |  tracing overhead |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| latency(second)  | 4.0045  | 4.0044  | 2.5026  | 0.0000163  |


HiQ just traced the `main.py` file running without touching one line of its code.
